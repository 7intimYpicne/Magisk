# Java For Windows 7 64 Bit
 
 
On Windows, the same java executable can load DLLs for different versions of Java. It looks at the directory from which it's running to see if it contains libraries for a particular version of Java. If not, it uses the Windows Registry to locate the default version of Java for the system.
 
The Java installer will put a copy of java.exe (but no libraries) in the the Windows\system32 C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Oracle\Java\javapath directory, and add that directory to the beginning of the PATH variable.

If you don't use a full path, the copy of java.exe to run is found by using the PATH system variable. Since this directory doesn't contain the DLLs of a particular Java runtime version, one is located one by looking at the registry.
 
I solved it by renaming those files to java\_wrong.exe, javaw\_wrong.exe, and javaws\_wrong.exe. Only after doing that does it pick up the correct version of java as defined in JAVA\_HOME and PATH. I renamed the files thusly because that deleted them in an easily reversible manner.
 
Check your %PATH% environmental variable. It's what's making Windows find one before the other. The path (as the post you linked to said) should point to %JAVA\_HOME%\bin;. Again, the post you linked to gave you a way to set this using a batch file.
 
(For others who might not know this: The easiest way to inspect the %PATH% is to open a command prompt and type echo %PATH%. You can also get there by right-clicking on Computer in the right pane of the Start Menu and choosing Properties, then Advanced System Settings, and the tne Environmental Variables button.)
 
Suppose you have install JDK 10 after JDK 8 and in the system environment variable set path like "C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath" then Java version control by this path. it will ignore JAVA\_HOME even jdk 1.8 path set hereSo remove "C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath" in path to get effect of JAVA\_HOME path
 
For my Case in 'Path' variable there was a parameter added like 'C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath;'.This location was having java.exe, javaw.exe and javaws.exe from java 8 which is newly installed via jdk.exe from Oracle.

I had Java 7 and 8 installed and I want to redirect to java 7 but the java version in my cmd prompt window shows Java 8.
Added Java 7 bin directory path (C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0\_10\bin) to PATH variable at the end, but did not work out and shows Java 8. So I changed the Java 7 path to the starting of the path value and it worked.
Opened a new cmd prompt window and checked my java version and now it shows Java 7
 
After setting the JAVA\_HOME and JRE\_HOME environment variables to the desired java folders' runtimes (in my case it is Java 7), the command java -version should show your desired java runtime. I remark there's no need to mess with the registry.
 
This issue is probably because of the earlier versions of Java installed in your System.First check your Environment Variables Carefully and remove all the Environment Variables related to the previous versions of JAVA and replace those paths to
 
There's an additional factor here; in addition to the java executables that the java installation puts wherever you ask it to put them, on windows, the java installer also puts copies of some of those executables in your windows system32 directory, so you will likely be using which every java executable was installed most recently.
 
Just in case if you are using .BAT file as Windows Service, I would suggest to uninstall the Windows service and reinstall it again after changing the %JAVA\_HOME% to point to the right Java version..
 
I had the same problem, in user environment variable settings I was having JAVA\_HOME and PATH configured properly but it didn't work. As I update my system environment variables then it started to work.
 
A window must have either a frame, dialog, or another window defined as its owner when it's constructed. In a multi-screen environment, you can create a Window on a different screen device by constructing the Window with Window(Window, GraphicsConfiguration). The GraphicsConfiguration object is one of the GraphicsConfiguration objects of the target screen device. In a virtual device multi-screen environment in which the desktop area could span multiple physical screen devices, the bounds of all configurations are relative to the virtual device coordinate system. The origin of the virtual-coordinate system is at the upper left-hand corner of the primary physical screen. Depending on the location of the primary screen in the virtual device, negative coordinates are possible, as shown in the following figure. In such an environment, when calling setLocation, you must pass a virtual coordinate to this method. Similarly, calling getLocationOnScreen on a Window returns virtual device coordinates. Call the getBounds method of a GraphicsConfiguration to find its origin in the virtual coordinate system. The following code sets the location of a Window at (10, 10) relative to the origin of the physical screen of the corresponding GraphicsConfiguration. If the bounds of the GraphicsConfiguration is not taken into account, the Window location would be set at (10, 10) relative to the virtual-coordinate system and would appear on the primary physical screen, which might be different from the physical screen of the specified GraphicsConfiguration. Window w = new Window(Window owner, GraphicsConfiguration gc); Rectangle bounds = gc.getBounds(); w.setLocation(10 + bounds.x, 10 + bounds.y); Note: the location and size of top-level windows (including Windows, Frames, and Dialogs) are under the control of the desktop's window management system. Calls to setLocation, setSize, and setBounds are requests (not directives) which are forwarded to the window management system. Every effort will be made to honor such requests. However, in some cases the window management system may ignore such requests, or modify the requested geometry in order to place and size the Window in a way that more closely matches the desktop settings. Due to the asynchronous nature of native event handling, the results returned by getBounds, getLocation, getLocationOnScreen, and getSize might not reflect the actual geometry of the Window on screen until the last request has been processed. During the processing of subsequent requests these values might change accordingly while the window management system fulfills the requests. An application may set the size and location of an invisible Window arbitrarily, but the window management system may subsequently change its size and/or location when the Window is made visible. One or more ComponentEvents will be generated to indicate the new geometry. Windows are capable of generating the following WindowEvents: WindowOpened, WindowClosed, WindowGainedFocus, WindowLostFocus.Since:JDK1.0See Also:WindowEvent, addWindowListener(java.awt.event.WindowListener), BorderLayout, Serialized FormNested Class SummaryNested Classes Modifier and TypeClass and Descriptionprotected class Window.AccessibleAWTWindowThis class implements accessibility support for the Window class.static class Window.TypeEnumeration of available *window types*.Nested classes/interfaces inherited from class java.awt.ContainerContainer.AccessibleAWTContainerNested classes/interfaces inherited from class java.awt.ComponentComponent.AccessibleAWTComponent, Component.BaselineResizeBehavior, Component.BltBufferStrategy, Component.FlipBufferStrategyField SummaryFields inherited from class java.awt.ComponentaccessibleContext, BOTTOM\_ALIGNMENT, CENTER\_ALIGNMENT, LEFT\_ALIGNMENT, RIGHT\_ALIGNMENT, TOP\_ALIGNMENTFields inherited from interface java.awt.image.ImageObserverABORT, ALLBITS, ERROR, FRAMEBITS, HEIGHT, PROPERTIES, SOMEBITS, WIDTHConstructor SummaryConstructors Constructor and DescriptionWindow(Frame owner)Constructs a new, initially invisible window with the specified Frame as its owner.Window(Window owner)Constructs a new, initially invisible window with the specified Window as its owner.Window(Window owner, GraphicsConfiguration gc)Constructs a new, initially invisible window with the specified owner Window and a GraphicsConfiguration of a screen device.Method SummaryAll Methods Static Methods Instance Methods Concrete Methods Deprecated Methods Modifier and TypeMethod and DescriptionvoidaddNotify()Makes this Window displayable by creating the connection to its native screen resource.voidaddPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener)Adds a PropertyChangeListener to the listener list.voidaddPropertyChangeListener(String propertyName, PropertyChangeListener listener)Adds a PropertyChangeListener to the listener list for a specific property.voidaddWindowFocusListener(WindowFocusListener l)Adds the specified window focus listener to receive window events from this window.voidaddWindowListener(WindowListener l)Adds the specified window listener to receive window events from this window.voidaddWindowStateListener(WindowStateListener l)Adds the specified window state listener to receive window events from this window.voidapplyResourceBundle(ResourceBundle rb)Deprecated.
